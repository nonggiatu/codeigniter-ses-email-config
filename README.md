codeigniter-ses-email-config
============================

Email configuration for sending email with Amazon SES

Why this?
---------
I have met problem when switched from Google SMTP to Amazon SES and it took much time to trouble with. So I decided to share my configuration so that it could help someone who had that problem also.

How to use this?
----------------
Just copy this file to application/config folder and set proper hostname, username and password. Then you can use Codeigniter's email library as normal.
